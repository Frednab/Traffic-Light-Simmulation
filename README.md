# 🚦 Traffic Light Intersection Simulation

This project simulates a traffic light system at a four-way intersection using Python. It visually represents vehicle movement (bus, truck, car) across the intersection while obeying traffic light rules.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── simulation.ipynb       # Main Jupyter Notebook with simulation logic
├── truck.png              # Truck image asset
├── bus.png                # Bus image asset
├── car.png                # Car image asset
├── intersection.png       # Background intersection layout
├── README.md              # This file
```

## 🛠 Features

- Animated vehicle movements through the intersection
- Traffic light sequencing (red, yellow, green)
- Real-time simulation inside a Jupyter Notebook
- Modular and easy-to-extend design

## 📸 Visual Assets

- `intersection.png` – background layout of the four-way junction
- `car.png`, `bus.png`, `truck.png` – images used to represent vehicles

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-light-simulation.git
   cd traffic-light-simulation
   ```

2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook simulation.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells to start the simulation.

> **Note:** Make sure all image assets are in the same directory as the notebook to render correctly.

## 💡 Customization

- Add new vehicle types or directions
- Change traffic light logic (e.g., add pedestrian signals)
- Extend with sensor-triggered lights
