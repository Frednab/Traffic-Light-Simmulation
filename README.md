🚦 Traffic Light Intersection Simulation
This project simulates a traffic light system at a four-way intersection using Python. It visually represents vehicle movement (bus, truck, car) across the intersection while obeying traffic light rules.

🛠 Features
Animated vehicle movements through the intersection

Traffic light sequencing (red, yellow, green)

Real-time simulation inside a Jupyter Notebook

Modular and easy-to-extend design

▶️ How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-light-simulation.git
cd traffic-light-simulation
Open the notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook simulation.ipynb
Run all cells to start the simulation.

Note: Make sure all image assets are in the same directory as the notebook to render correctly.

💡 Customization
Add new vehicle types or directions

Change traffic light logic (e.g., add pedestrian signals)

Extend with sensor-triggered lights
